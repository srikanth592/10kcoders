    <p><h2>Supreme Court rules it can directly grant divorce to couples under Article 142.</h2></p>
    <p>On Monday, a constitution or five-judge bench of the Supreme Court held that it can exercise its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to directly grant a decree of divorce to consenting parties, in cases of irretrievable breakdown of marriage, without referring the parties to a family court where they must wait for 6 to 18 months for a decree of divorce by mutual consent.

    </p>
    <p>What was the case that took the Supreme Court route under Article 142?
    </p>
    <p>In 2014, a case was filed in the SC, titled Shilpa Sailesh vs. Varun Sreenivasan, where the parties sought a divorce under Article 142, stating that their marriage had irretrievably broken down. This is one of the legally recognised grounds for divorce, available to both the husband and the wife. In a recent SC judgment in the Shri Rakesh Raman vs. Smt Kavita case, the court said “irretrievable breakdown of marriage” can be read under the grounds of cruelty, under S13 (1) (a) of the Hindu Marriage Act

    </p>
    <p>In the present case, the court granted divorce to the parties using its Article 142 powers. However, it clarified that the question of whether it can directly grant divorce under Article 142 without referring the parties to a family court would remain open. This was done in light of the multiple similar petitions pending before the top court on the same question.
